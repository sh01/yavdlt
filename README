==== Meta ====
This is a README file documenting Yet Another Video Download Tool, abbreviated
YAVDLT.


==== Functionality ====
TAVDLT is a cmdline program to download data from Youtube, and perform various
kinds of post-processing on said data. One of its design goals is compatibility;
if there's any decent way to get at a YT video, TAVDLT should allow you to do
it without unnecessary pain.
In addition, YAVDLT has a larger feature set than most similar tools; currently,
its feature set includes:

  * Downloading Audio/Video files, in any format supported by YT.

  * Downloading TimedText data and converting it to the SSA subtitle format,
    which is widely supported by software media players.

  * Downloading Annotation data and converting it to the SSA subtitle format.

  * Muxing downloaded Video/Audio and sub (timedtext, annotation or both) data
    into a single MKV file per YT video.

  * Flexible format selection heuristics; you can define any number of format
    preference lists, and choose one for each download - allowing you to choose
    the specific tradeoff between file size and video quality, without having to
    keep in mind the details of YT video formats on each download.

  * Support for custom URL mangling schemes, allowing you to send HTTP requests
    through http-layer gateways.

  * Flexible input of video specs; you can specify videos as any combination of:
    * Raw youtube ids, e.g. 'dhRUe-gz690'
    * Watch page urls, e.g. 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhRUe-gz690'
    * Embed urls, e.g. 'http://www.youtube.com/v/dhRUe-gz690'

  * Support for downloading all videos from a playlist

  * Resuming video file downloads that were interrupted for any reason.

  * Detailed download progress reports.

==== System requirements ====
  * CPython 3.1+

Note that use of YAVDLT on non-posix-like OSes is currently highly
experimental - it should be possibly in theory, but at this time no test data
on how well it works in practice is available.


==== Usage examples ====
To download a single video, including any annotations and timedtext data,
any of these work:
 ./yavdlt.py dhRUe-gz690
 ./yavdlt.py http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhRUe-gz690
 ./yavdlt.py http://www.youtube.com/v/dhRUe-gz690

To download all videos from a playlist:
 ./yavdlt.py --playlist CDFEA6D52E5CC0EC

To force a video in a specific youtube format:
 ./yavdlt.py --fmt 18 dhRUe-gz690

To mux downloaded AV and sub data into MKV files:
 ./yavdlt.py --mkv grCTXGW3sxQ

Naturally, --help is also supported.

==== Config ====
A config file isn't necessary for YTAVDLT use, but using one allows you to
influence its behaviour in more detail than cmdline switches.
By default, YTAVDLT will look for its config file in ~/.yavdlt/config;
this can be overridden using the --config switch.

For details on configuration, see the example config file 'example.conf'
you should have gotten along with this file.
